Rotating 3d plots with the mouse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rotating three-dimensional plots with the mouse has been made more intuitive.
The plot now reacts the same way to mouse movement, independent of the
particular orientation at hand; and it is possible to control all 3 rotational
degrees of freedom (azimuth, elevation, and roll). It uses a variation on
Ken Shoemake's ARCBALL [Shoemake1992]_.
