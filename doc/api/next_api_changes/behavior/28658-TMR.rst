ScalarMappable changed to ColorizingArtist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Classes that used to inherit from `cm.ScalarMappable` now inherit from 
`colorizer.ColorizingArtist` instead. All the existing attributes on 
`cm.ScalarMappable` are available on the equivalent `colorizer.ColorizingArtist`
but type checks for `cm.ScalarMappable` will fail.
